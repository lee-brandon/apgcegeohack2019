# apgcegeohack2019

Results from the 2019 APGCE Geohack, held in ADAX @ Bangsar South, Malaysia.

If APGCE was a call on papers, the GEOHack is a call for solutions. The challenges of the subsurface is nothing new but an eye for data would help geoscientists to set aside the rock hammer, and instead hammer on a keyboard to hack these problems.

10 teams of professionals and students are given the chance to attempt to improve, innovate and challenge one another with their solutions using Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL).

The objective is to work with actual Malaysian field data including wells, seismics and more to come up with ways for geoscientists to obtain better insights.
